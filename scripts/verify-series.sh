# The gate. Applies patches/<version>/series to the PRISTINE upstream QEMU
# release tarball and proves the result is exactly what we expect.
#
#   ./scripts/verify-series.sh 11.1.0 /path/to/qemu-11.1.0.tar.xz
#   ./scripts/verify-series.sh 11.1.0 <tarball> --record   # (re)record patchedTree
#
# Three assertions, in increasing strength:
#
#   1. the tarball is the one base.json pins       (sha256)
#   2. the series applies with STRICT context      (git am, no --3way)
#   3. the patched tree hashes to base.json's `patchedTree`
#
# (3) is the one that earns its keep. linux_builder's 6db7363 had to repair a
# patch that was CORRUPT rather than stale -- a corruption that still applied.
# A recorded tree hash makes that unrepresentable: any change to what the series
# produces, from any cause, fails the gate.
#
# STRICT CONTEXT IS DELIBERATE. `git am` without --3way is used on purpose: a
# patch that needs 3-way resolution means upstream moved under us, and we want
# that to be a loud failure that a human ports, not a silent auto-merge.
